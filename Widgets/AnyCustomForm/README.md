# AnyCustomForm

This widget allows the rendering of ANY Custom Form by passing the GUID in the URL as a querystring parameter called form.  Adding this allows all custom forms to be rendered and hosted on a single webpage.

## Features

Simple widget that renders the stock custom form widget but fills in the Form_GUID so you don't need multiple pages to host various custom forms.  This widget doesn't require the Custom Widgets Engine as it is only basic javascript.
