# Asset Folder Definition

Use this folder to store any custom javascript, images, or CSS that your widget may require. While this folder's structure is not pre-set, please try to use a consistent folder structure for your future self. Everything in the assets folder will need to be copied to your website and made available to the widget.

- css
- js
- img

## Installation Notes

Assets like CSS or Javascript files will need to be accessible and loaded into the website hosting the widget. These files will need correct relative or full paths to the files in use and are added using normal web conventions.

```html
<!-- Custom Style Sheets Used in this Example -->
